  # Portfolio CMS Integration Project
  
  This project demonstrates the integration of Decap CMS with an existing Vite-based portfolio website. The implementation showcases how to add content management capabilities while preserving existing functionality.
  
  ### Key Features
  
  - **Content Collections**: Four distinct content types (music, art, photos, code)
  - **File Management**: Organized asset uploads with categorized subdirectories
  - **Git-based Workflow**: Content versioning through Git Gateway
  - **Netlify Integration**: Seamless deployment and identity management
  
  ### Technical Implementation
  
  The CMS integration follows best practices for:
  - Minimal configuration overhead
  - Preservation of existing functionality
  - Scalable content organization
  - Developer-friendly workflow

  ### Preserving Existing Functionality
  The primary challenge was integrating the CMS without disrupting the existing chat and contact features. This required careful configuration of routing and asset management.
  
  ### Content Schema Design
  Designing flexible but structured schemas for diverse content types (music, art, photos, code) required balancing specificity with usability.
  
  ### Development Workflow
  Ensuring the CMS works seamlessly with the existing `netlify dev` workflow while maintaining the Vite build process.

  ### CMS Architecture
  - Decap CMS provides excellent Git-based content management without requiring a separate backend
  - Proper content schema design is crucial for long-term maintainability
  - Asset organization should be planned upfront to avoid restructuring later
  
  ### Integration Strategy
  - Incremental integration allows for testing and validation at each step
  - Preserving existing functionality requires careful attention to routing and build processes
  - Documentation during implementation helps with future maintenance
  
  ### Development Best Practices
  - Sample content is essential for testing and demonstration
  - Clear folder structure improves developer experience
  - Configuration should be environment-aware for development vs. production
