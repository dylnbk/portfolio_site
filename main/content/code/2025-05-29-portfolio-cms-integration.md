  # Portfolio CMS Integration
  
  This project integrates Decap CMS with my existing Vite-based portfolio website. The implementation introduced content management capabilities while preserving existing functionality. It is a great introduction to building a static site that still feels feature rich, with an integrated CMS and auth system that does not require a full backend.
  
  ### Key Features
  
  - **Content Collections**: Four distinct content types (music, art, photos, code)
  - **File Management**: Organized asset uploads with categorized subdirectories
  - **Git-based Workflow**: Content versioning through Git Gateway
  - **Netlify Integration**: Full deployment and identity management
  
  ### Technical Implementation
  
  The CMS integration follows best practices for:
  - Minimal configuration overhead
  - Preservation of existing functionality
  - Scalable content organization
  - Developer-friendly workflow

  ### Preserving Existing Functionality
  The primary challenge was integrating the CMS without disrupting the existing chat and contact features. This required careful configuration of routing and asset management.
  
  ### Content Schema Design
  Designing flexible but structured schemas for diverse content types (music, art, photos, code) required balancing specificity with usability.
  
  ### Development Workflow
  Ensuring the CMS works seamlessly with the existing `netlify dev` workflow while maintaining the Vite build process.

  ### CMS Architecture
  - Decap CMS provides excellent Git-based content management without requiring a separate backend
  - Proper content schema design is crucial for long-term maintainability
  - Asset organization should be planned upfront to avoid restructuring later
  - Documentation during implementation helps with future maintenance
  
  ### Development Best Practices
  - Sample content is essential for testing and demonstration
  - Clear folder structure improves workflow
  - Configuration should be environment-aware for development vs. production
